						<p>Hi, my name is Josseph Downs, and I am a full stack software developer from Chicago, Illinois. I am a proud father of two boys, ages 4 and 2, and being a dad is the highlight of my life. Outside of my career, I have a passion for all things related to art. I love to paint,  i have been part of theater productions, i also make music, and create short Photography videos that I upload to YouTube. However, my main hobby is photography, which I have been doing for the past 12 years.</p>
                        <p>I emigrated to the United States when I was 13 years old from a small island called San Andres Islas, which belongs to the country of Colombia. My mother's side of the family has a background in farming, specifically in rice cropping and cattle ranching. My love for technology has always been present, and I'm always looking for ways to incorporate technology into underrepresented parts of the world.</p> 
                        <p>One of my favorite genres of books and movies is science fiction, which led me to develop an interest in Quantum Physics, Quantum Computing, and Artificial Intelligence. Learning about these subjects has been a great pleasure of mine. In general, I enjoy learning about everything and anything.</p>
