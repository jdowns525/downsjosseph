						<h5>Hello! I'm Josseph Downs, Manufacturing Data and Systems Engineer based in Chicago, Illinois. I am deeply passionate about technology, particularly in the fields of Database Development, Quantum Computing, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. I am skilled at creating intuitive applications and solving complex problems. Currently, I am employed full-time at John Deere, where I focus on Smart Connected Factory Analytics and Development at Dubuque Works. My professional skill set includes HMI Programming, Ignition Systems, Various Database Management Systems for Data Wrangling, and more. Before joining John Deere, I worked in customer service and IT support for Chicago Public Schools and got my training as a Full Stack Software Developer. This experience solidified my passion for Software Development and led me to specialize in Ruby on Rails, Python, and JavaScript. Additionally, I have a strong background in Database Design, Web Development, and other essential tools and languages.</h5>
                        <h5>Outside of my professional life, I am a father to two wonderful boys and have a deep passion for art, especially photography. I find joy in capturing everyday moments and preserving them as memories. I was born and raised in San Andres, a small Caribbean island in Colombia. This has instilled in me a desire to bring technology to underrepresented areas and solve the unique problems they face. Additionally, I am an avid science fiction fan and am fascinated by the potential of Quantum Computing and AI. I am committed to continuous learning and self-improvement in order to stay at the forefront of technological advancements and use my skills to make a meaningful impact.</h5>
