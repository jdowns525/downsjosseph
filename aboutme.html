						<h3>Hi!, My name is Josseph Downs, and I am a Full Stack Software Developer from Chicago, Illinois. Prior to being in this field, my experience ranged from custumer service and IT Support for the Chicago Public Schools, but i have always wanted to work doing something where i found myself working in the back-end side of how things work.  </h3>
                        <h3>I am a father of two boys, ages 4 and 2, and being a dad is the highlight of my life. Being a father has taught me more about myself and life than I could have ever learned from anything else. Outside of my career, I have a passion for all things related to art. I love to paint, I have been part of theater productions, I also make music on my downtime, and create short photography videos that I upload to YouTube every week. However, my main hobby is photography, which I have been doing for the past 12 years and I recently acquired my dream camera, a Leica Q2.</h3>
                        <h3>I came to the United States when I was 13 years old from a small island in the caribbean called San Andres Islas, which belongs to the country of Colombia. My mother's side of the family has a background in farming, specifically in rice crops and cattle. This upbringing paired with my love for technology have always gone hand in hand, and I'm always looking for ways and ideas in how I could be of help to incorporate technology into these underrepresented parts of the world that would benefit from these advancements.</h3> 
                        <h3>One of my favorite genres of books and movies is that of science fiction, which sparked my attention to develop an interest in various technology fields, some of those being Quantum Computing, and Artificial Intelligence. Learning about these subjects has been a great interest of mine since i could remember. Seeing how fast our world is advancing in these fields that once were thought to be theoretical is very exciting for me. Generally, I enjoy learning about everything and anything that i may find of interest, could range from the most mundane to the most intricate or complex. That seems to be a switch i could never turn off. </h2>
